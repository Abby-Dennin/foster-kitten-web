              <h4>How to keep foster kittens safe</h4>
              <p>When I first joined tik tok I posted a video of my kitten meowing from
                inside his crate. I was shocked to see within 30 minutes someone was already
                attempting to "cancel" me in the comments for keeping a kitten locked up. I have
                fostered kittens with and without crates, and after a few years of experience I
                would like to share my opinion on the big crate debate. </p>

              <h4>Learn more about a kitten with a big heart</h4>
              <p>Normally kitten season occurs between late spring and early fall,
                but every now and then a kitten can pop up later in the fall and during
                the winter. I got a call about a healthy 7 week old kitten that was very
                frightened and needed a little extra love before going out to his forever home.

        <p>My name is Abby Dennin and I have been fostering kittens since 2018. Currently
          I have successfully fostered and adopted out over 30 kittens. I created this website
          to spread knowledge about the fostering process and of course share some adorable kitten
          pictures. I hope to encourage more people to foster kittens and provide information for
          those who are interested.</p>
