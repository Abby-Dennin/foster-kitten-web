        <p>Should you keep kittens in a crate?</p>
        <p>When I first joined tik tok I posted a video of my kitten meowing from 
          inside his crate. I was shocked to see within 30 minutes someone was already 
          attempting to "cancel" me in the comments for keeping a kitten locked up. I have 
          fostered kittens with and without crates, and after a few years of experience I 
          would like to share my opinion on the big crate debate.</p>

        <p>A Christmas Surprise</p>
        <p>Normally kitten season is occurs between late spring and early fall, 
          but every now and then a kitten can pop up later in the fall and during 
          the winter. I got a call about a healthy 7 week old kitten that was very 
          frightened and needed a little extra love before going out to his forever home.

        <div class="img" style="height:100px;">Image</div>
        <p>My name is Abby Dennin and I have been fostering kittens since 2018. Currently 
          I have successfully fostered and adopted out over 30 kittens. I created this website 
          to spread knowledge about the fostering process and of course share some adorable kitten 
          pictures. I hope to encourage more people to foster kittens and provide information for 
          those who are interested.</p>
