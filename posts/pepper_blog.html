                <h2>Pepper's Story</h2>
                <h4>Learn more about a kitten with a big heart</h5>
                    <img class="profile" src="../images/pepper_02.jpg" style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;" alt="Kitten">
                    <p> Normally kitten season is occurs between late spring and early fall,
                        but every now and then a kitten can pop up later in the fall and during
                        the winter. I got a call about a healthy 7 week old kitten that was very
                        frightened and needed a little extra love before going out to his forever home.<br><br>

                        I was home from school for a few weeks for the holidays so I decided to take him in. To keep with 
                        the holiday spirt, I named him Peppermint (Pepper for short). The minute I brought him inside I could
                        tell he was a lot more comfortable. Shelters can be overwhelming for younger kittens found on their own, 
                        so sometimes just having a quiet place to get used to being in a home can do wonders. <br><br>
                    
                        After a day or two of hiding and shying away from me, he finally starting to come out of his shell. Almost overnight
                        he turned into a complete cuddle bug that never stopped purring. I brought him back to the shelter when it was time to go
                        back to school and he was ready to be adopted. About a week later I got word that he had been adopted and I didn't think
                        much about it after that. <br><br>

                        A few weeks later I was on facebook and saw that the humane society in my town had posted a picture of him. When I clicked in to
                        the story, I was heartbroken. The vet had discovered that Pepper had a cogenital heart defect and had been brought back to the shelter. He was diagnosed with Patent Ductus 
                        Arteriousus, which means his blood was recirculating through his lungs and the left side of the heart.
                        The vet said that without interventional surgery, which would be very expensive, Pepper would not live past the age of two. Thankfully, 
                        by spreading word on social media the humane society was able to raise enough money for the surgery and Pepper was able to get better. <br><br>

                        Unfortunately, when I came home in the spring Pepper was still at the shelter. It is much harder for kittens to get adopted once they get older
                        and Pepper had not been chosen yet. Luckily that meant I got to go visit him while I was home which was a lot of fun. I usually don't get to hear 
                        about the kittens once they grow up into adult cats, so it was really special to see him. That summer he was finally adopted by a loving family!<br><br>

                        Then next christmas, one year after I had fostered Pepper, I saw another post of him on facebook. I was worried he was sick again, but was delighted to see
                        that it was just an update of him in his new home, snuggling with his new cat brother! I am so happy that Pepper finally found his furrever home!<br><br>
