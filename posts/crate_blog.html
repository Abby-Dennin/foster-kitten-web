                <h2>To Crate or Not To Crate...</h2>
                <h4>How to keep foster kittens safe</h4>

                <p> >When I first joined tik tok I posted a video of my kitten meowing from
                    inside his crate. I was shocked to see within 30 minutes someone was already
                    attempting to "cancel" me in the comments for keeping a kitten locked up. I have
                    fostered kittens with and without crates, and after a few years of experience I
                    would like to share my opinion on the big crate debate.<br><br>

                    I was home from school for a few weeks for the holidays so I decided to take him in. To keep with
                    the holiday spirt, I named him Peppermint (Pepper for short). The minute I brought him inside I
                    could
                    tell he was a lot more comfortable. Shelters can be overwhelming for younger kittens found on their
                    own,
                    so sometimes just having a quiet place to get used to being in a home can do wonders. <br><br>

                    After a day or two of hiding and shying away from me, he finally starting to come out of his shell.
                    Almost overnight
                    he turned into a complete cuddle bug that never stopped purring. I brought him back to the shelter
                    when it was time to go
                    back to school and he was ready to be adopted. About a week later I got word that he had been
                    adopted and I didn't think
                    much about it after that. <br><br>

                    A few weeks later I was on facebook and saw that the humane society in my town had posted a picture
                    of him. When I clicked in to
                    the story, I was heartbroken. The vet had discovered that Pepper had a cogenital heart defect and
                    had been brought back to the shelter. He was diagnosed with Patent Ductus
                    Arteriousus, which means his blood was recirculating through his lungs and the left side of the
                    heart.
                    The vet said that without interventional surgery, which would be very expensive, Pepper would not
                    live past the age of two. Thankfully,
                    by spreading word on social media the humane society was able to raise enough money for the surgery
                    and Pepper was able to get better. <br><br>

                    Unfortunately, when I came home in the spring Pepper was still at the shelter. It is much harder for
                    kittens to get adopted once they get older
                    and Pepper had not been chosen yet. Luckily that meant I got to go visit him while I was home which
                    was a lot of fun. I usually don't get to hear
                    about the kittens once they grow up into adult cats, so it was really special to see him. That
                    summer he was finally adopted by a loving family!<br><br>

                    Then next christmas, one year after I had fostered Pepper, I saw another post of him on facebook. I
                    was worried he was sick again, but was delighted to see
                    that it was just an update of him in his new home, snuggling with his new cat brother! I am so happy
                    that Pepper finally found his furrever home!<br><br>
