                <p> >When I first joined tik tok I posted a video of my kitten meowing from
                    inside his crate. I was shocked to see within 30 minutes someone was already
                    attempting to "cancel" me in the comments for keeping a kitten locked up. I have
                    fostered kittens with and without crates, and after a few years of experience I
                    would like to share my opinion on the big crate debate.<br><br>

                    For an adult cat, unless they are very sick and need to restrict movement, I don't think they should be inside a crate.
                    Adult cats are fairly independent and are almost always litter trained making it easy for them to roam about the house. While
                    they may get into the occasional trouble of scratching furniture or knocking things over, that is no reason to keep them in 
                    a crate. <br><br>

                    With kittens, it is a completely different story. They are fragile and still learning about the world. I have never let a foster kitten have
                    free range of the house and I am certain I never will. There are just to many dangers to them, whether it is chewing on something unsafe or getting stuck somewhere.
                    It is also important to make sure they always have quick access to the litterbox when learning to use it to avoid accidents in other areas of the house.
                    It is much better for kittens to learn what they can and can't do in a safe, controlled environment. <br><br>

                    This is not to say that a kitten should always be in the crate, that is not necessarily the answer. It is important to create a small area where the kittens
                    can play and roam about safely when supervised. I usually like to square off a section of the room with plastic tile walls. I also place a shower curtain under it
                    because kittens can be quite messy and that makes it easier to clean. The area is about 6ft square and has plently of room for them to climb and run around. This also means
                    that they are always able to have the litterbox, fresh water, and food that is easy to find at all times. <br><br>

                    For night time and any other times where I am not there to supervise them, I will put them in a crate. I got a large one off a amazon and it can comfortably fit a litterbox, two food bowls, 
                    and a couple of kittens. It is important to keep the crate clean, odds are they will spill food and water and kick litter around, and you want to make sure there is a nice place for them to sleep.
                    I recommend getting bowls that attach to the side of the crate. That way they can be attached low enough for the kittens to reach and there is less chance of spilling. <br><br>

                    Kittens get fostered for many reasons, but usually it is because they are too young or too sick to be adopted. That means they need to be treated differently than your average house
                    cat and extra precautions are necessary to keep them safe. Then when they are older and ready for a furrever home, they will know how to keep themselves safe. All in all, you know your kitten
                    best and it is always important to do what is right for them, no two kittens are alike. But generally, I would recommend using a crate. <br><br>
